markdown: "This website is a vital component of the package of remedies put in place following our market investigation. Along with other measures, such as data sharing, we expect that our remedy package will open up the market to greater competition, so that customers get more choice and lower prices. I have been impressed by the way in which the home credit industry has worked with other stakeholders to deliver this project."
